Design the Student class.
• The attributes are a student ID, a first name, a last name, a date of birth,
and a list containing the grades obtained by the student.
• Write a constructor for this class that takes all the attributes and another
constructor that initializes the grades list as empty, along with getters and setters
for all attributes.
• The class will also have the following methods:
▪ calculateGradeAverage(), which calculates the student's grade average.
▪ isExcellent(), which returns true if the student's grade average is greater than
or equal to 28.

Design the Professor class. • The attributes are an ID, a first name, a last name,
and the name of the course taught by the professor.
• Write a constructor for this class that takes all the attributes and another constructor
without the course taught, along with getters and setters for all attributes.
• The class will also have the following method:
▪ assignGrade(Student s, int grade),
which adds the grade to the student s grades list if the grade is greater than or
equal to 18;
otherwise, it prints a message to inform the student that they have failed.

Finally, write a Main class in which we will test our code.
In the main method, the following should be done:
• Create 4 students and 2 professors using the different constructors.
• Test the assignGrade() method with input parameters of your choice.
• Put the students in an array and do the same for the professors.
• Print the first names and last names of all excellent students.
• Print the first name and last name of the student with the highest grade average.
